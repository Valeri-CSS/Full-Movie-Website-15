### What I learned

This is my first website with more of pages, with this project I learned lot of thing for example: how to creat a Table I used this for Rating page on the website. I learnd olso how to connect more of pages with each other. I used at the firs time youtube videos as a trailer on my website and I olso used <a href="#"></a> Tag to connect somthing with the link, for example by klicking on the image to open other page and I leardn olso how to chouse where to open the page for this I used <a target="_parent"></a> to open the page in the same window.   

### problems
I'm aware that there are two couple of problems on the website, for example on the hom page, clicking on the image of the interstellar doesn't open a page, but I'm already working on to fix this problems.
